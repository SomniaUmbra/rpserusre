continue playing.

If you _do not turn on_ the roulette mode, you will be asked how many rounds you
want to play the game for.

For each round of the game, you will be asked your move. And then the computer
will choose it's move at random. The winner will be declared afterwards.

and delete every file on your computer. It may or may not be successful in doing
so, but it might leave irreversible data loss, including but not limited to your
